# SceneKit Grid Experiment
This micro-project is a series of quick experiments designed to add-up to build the Livenote app. It experiments on how to construct a grid view for a 3D modeling environment in which user-interface works well in moving 3D models to construct a scene. 

Incase you're wondering what the Livenote app is, it's the Augmented Reality (AR) version of Keynote or PowerPoint. The goal is to create a pocket projector in which users can share ideas with others by allowing them to present in 3D scenes.
